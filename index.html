            <p class="paragraph">Hi, there! My name is Becca Harris, and I'm just a girl who wants to learn how to code. My interest in coding
               came about around two years ago when I began my current position as a QA Engineer at Providigm, LLC. Since then, 
               I have been trying to teach myself and I have built a couple of projects using Angular and am in the process of
               building another with Ruby on Rails. I enjoy learning to code very much, and am excited to learn more!
               <br><br>
               I love puppies and kitties and pretty much any other kind of animal - snakes included. I have 3 puppies and two kitties of my own.
               In my free time, I love to run, play golf with my dad, and try to teach myself how to code. 
               I have done some cool things and been to some cool places. In 2017, I took a vacation to 
               South Africa for two weeks. I go to Cozumel as often as I can (which is really not that often) and I love to scuba dive. I also 
               spent some time in Costa Rica a couple of years back. In my daily life, you can find me at my job followed by the Cherry Creek 
               Dog Park followed by the gym followed by school and/or (finally) asleep in my bed.
